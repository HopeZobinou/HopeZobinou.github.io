    <h2>The Relationship Between Voting Habits, Education, and Income Levels</h2>
    <iframe src = "categories.html" width="1500px" height="500px:" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
    Majority of the voters vote sporadically and are college educated but their income varies.
    The voters that always vote are most likely to be college educated and have a high income. 
    The voters that rarely/never vote are most likely to have a high school or less education and 
    have low income. 
    <h2>Voter turnouts among counties/regions from 2014 to 2022</h2>

    The year that sticks out the most is 2020. The difference between 2020 and the other years is 2020 
    has a high percentage turnout and a high percentage of absentee ballots. My plot demonstrates this by 
    grouping the points toward the top right of the graph. The reason why both percentages are high is because of covid. 
    The virus made the government provide a safer option to vote. That option is absentee ballots. 
    Turnout percentage was high due to 2020 being a presidential election and the 2 candidates had lots of support
    from their respective sides of the political spectrum. No, because the animation forces the viewer 
    to notice the change since the points all moved into a funny location after it looked normal for the first couple of years. 
    The quick change in how the points are distributed through the years is more noticeable.
    <h2>Voter turnout in Virginia 2022</h2>

    On the map, you can see that voter turnout is high in the north and east sides of Virginia but in the 
    south and east sides of Virginia, it is much lower.
